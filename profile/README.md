**Artificial Intelligence as Thought Partner**
Building the tools to think better—together.

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub organization for **Frozen Gravity**, a research and product development lab focused on exploring artificial intelligence as a *thought partner*—not a tool for quick answers, but a collaborator in better thinking.

Inspired by the essay ["As We May Yet Think"](https://12nw.substack.com/p/as-we-may-yet-think) and 80 years of inquiry into the nature of human cognition, we believe the next frontier in AI is not automation, but augmentation of *mature thought*. Our mission is to build systems that support reflective decision-making, encourage rational deliberation, and mitigate cognitive biases through dialogue.

## Current Project

Our first application—codenamed **AIDP** (Artificial Intelligence Decision Partner)—is a Socratic, personalized AI that helps users surface hidden biases, clarify values, and evaluate tradeoffs through structured questioning and interactive decision matrices. It is not a chatbot. It is not a coach. It is a partner in thought.

## Goals

* Develop and release a public-facing MVP of the AIDP app
* Open-source key components of the reasoning and dialogue frameworks
* Conduct rigorous research into human-AI collaboration in decision-making
* Promote AI safety, alignment, and user agency in cognitive augmentation tools

## Roadmap

We are currently in **Phase One**:

* Finalizing the cognitive architecture of the decision partner
* Prototyping the dialogue engine
* Designing user studies to evaluate bias mitigation

Future phases will include personalization frameworks, and mobile app deployment.
